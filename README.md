# open-cognition
A collaborative journey to lay the groundwork for Artificial General Intelligence.

What is our goal?
To identify anything we may be missing and to bring all of the pieces of a Cognitive Architecture together to best utilize LLMs for our research. Our framework should establish a simple pathway for others to follow in our footsteps as we push the boundary on what is possible with generative AI.

How can I participate?
We first need to discuss what our hopes are while we bring all of our expertise to the table to agree on a common definition of a Cognitive Architecture which suits our needs. For the time being, all that is needed is to share ideas and opinions and build consensus.
